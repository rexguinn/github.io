St. Petersburg, Fl
------------------


![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/st_pet_fl.jpg) St. Petersburg, Fl

Saturday we stayed around the KOA until about 10:00 then headed out. Crossed the Everglades on HWY 41, stopped at the Cypre then on to Naples.

Sunday was very hot again, heading north along the west cost of Florida from Naples to St. Petersburg. We will spend Sunday night and Monday night aat the KOA on 19Alt. in St. Pete. This is a Gold KOA, but I don't think it's any better than the others we have stayed in. It does have a lot more Cabins. We have a tent site on the waters edge, some parts shady all day. It doesn't have electrical so we can't use the fan which really helps.

We met a couple from Pennsylvania that are staying here for a month. They have been retired for 3 years and just love it. They usually stay in one place for at least a month. But we would not get very far doing that.

Ft. De Soto
-----------

Monday we decided to go out to Ft. De Soto Historical Area. Its south west of the KOA about 1 hour in Pinellas County.
The Fort De Soto Historic Trail and Quartermaster Storehouse Museum was established in 1994. The fort was build in 1889 to defend the waterways west of St. Petersburg FL.
Battery Laidley was the primary defense for Fort De Soto. In 1902, eight 12-inch M 1890-M1 motors with a maximum range of 6.8 miles were mounted at the Fort.
When a ship was sited, the coordinates were relayed from observation points to the Relocating room and then to the Data Booth where it was posted for the gun crews to view. Each required a 12-man crew to manually load and aim the 54 pounds of power charge was placed after the projectiles were loaded. Each projectile weighted 800 to 1046 lbs.
Fort De Soto and Fort Dade were never used against an enemy. But the era was significant in terms of the evolution of modern weaponry (for that time).
The rest of the day was spend at camp just doing nothing but reading etc. 


North of Tampa and St. Pete
---------------------------

Tuesday heading north again, but trying to stay close to the gulf cost. It was still hot and not much of a breeze. There is really not much to say about Florida cost north of Tampa, lots of traffic and traffic lights. Unless you decide to stay in one place a few days, you just kinda go right on thru without seeing much. But we have done this part of the trip before.

Old Town Fl
-----------

Stopping early in Old Town about 50 miles south of Perry we found an old KOA campground along the Suwanee river. It was the least expensive so far and quiet only about 1/4 full. Tuesday evening was kinda slow and relaxed we set up the tent, and by now it only takes a few minutes. Then we sat by the river and watched it flow. There were a few boats and water skiers. But mostly it was quite.

During the early morning on Wednesday I heard what I thought was monkeys. But it was just birds making monkey noises.

Wednesday was a very lazy day up about 9:00 fixed breakfast, took showers, Logged on to the internet, read down by the river for most of the afternoon. Went in to Old town for dinner. Thats all folks.


West along Florida Panhandle
----------------------------

Thursday morning it looked like rain when we woke about 6:00. Decision time do we say in bed and maybe here another night waiting out the rain or do we go for it. Well we went for it. Took us about 30Min. to get on the road heading west. No rain until about 9:00 then it cut loose, this was the first time for our new rain gear. It's gortex light weight and lest the air pass thought so you don't sweat. In fact we both got a little cold, but not wet. The bike and trailer was really dirty when we pulled in to the KOA at Panama City Beach. Oh well it was time for it to have a bath anyway. This evening it was nice to ride a clean bike to dinner. But don't come to Panama City during Spring Break, it's fun for the kids, but us old folks like to have our sleep in peace and quite.

Tomorrow we will head out instead of hanging with the kids more then one night.

Until to morrow! 

Panama City to Mobile Al
------------------------

Friday from Panama City Beach FL. KOA. to Mobile AL.

It was cold and windy in Mobile, so we stayed in a Holiday Express since we were only going to be here one night anyway, and laundry was in the plans. Dinner was at Bob's Catfish restaurant, it was not near as good as Pay Lake in KY.

There is some very pretty country coming into Mobile from the southeast. Nice farms and well maintained areas.

Mobile is old and ugly at least along the truck route, but I guess most city's are that way.

Mobile to Vicksburg
-------------------

Saturday from Mobile to Vicksburg was thru the back roads all the way. From one road to the next when the one we were on ran out, as long as we were going north or west it was ok. Pulled into Vicksburg about 4:00 and checked into the Vicksburg Inn, right accross the street from the Vicksburg Military Park.


Vicksburg National Military Park
--------------------------------
