Mt St. Helen
------------

Leaving Newport on Thursday morning continuing on north to Astoria, then east on Hwy 30 to the first bridge crossiung the Columbia River into Longview, WA. We stopped and washed the bike in Longview, it was a very nice afternoon. Then up I-5 to 504 then east to Mt. St. Helen.

Mt. St. Helen above is an amazing view of Mother Nature's force. The eruption took out the north and west side of the mountain 2/3rds cubic mile. A Ranger talking to us there said he was giving this talk one time and an Engineer in the back was using a calculator so he ask what he was calculating. He hapened to be the owner of large earth moving trucks  he was calculating it would take  1 10 yard truck load dumped every minute of every hour every day every year for 600 years to fill
it all back in that blew out in 5 minutes. We did buy a dvd about the survivors, and rescues. There were 60 killed and or missing but it happened on Sunday morning if it would have been on Monday there would have been 3,000 loggers in the blast area. But on Sunday there was only 4 one survived.

We then headed north on 5 to Olympia and northwest on 101 to Sequim. On Friday we will catch the ferry across to Victoria, Canada from Port Angeles.
