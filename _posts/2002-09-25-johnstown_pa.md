Pennsylvania
------------ 

Now we are on our way home going south thru Pennyslvania on the back roads, trying to stay off the interstates and see some of the beautifull country side. One place we will stop for sure is Johnstown. It is the site of the worst floods in PA. I did not take any pictures so will put links to web sites with great photos.

Johnstown Flood
---------------

On May 31, 1889, a neglected dam and a phenomenal storm led to a catastrophe in which 2,209 people died. It's a story of great tragedy, but also of triumphant recovery. Visit the Johnstown Flood Museum, which is operated by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, to find out more about this shocking episode in American history.
