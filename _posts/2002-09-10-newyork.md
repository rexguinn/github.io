We left Lexington with Frank and Shirley Hosley heading for NY. Will pickup Dale and Carol in Cuba, NY. Franks sister and brother in law. I still haven't taken any pictures, but will shortly. The picture at the top is taken close to Lake Placid I think don't remember for sure.

Took a tour on the St. Lewarence river to see some of it's beautiful Islands. The tour guide was great telling us all kinds of information about the islands and the homes on them. The only way to get to these homes is by boat. So they are very private. A great video is [here](http://www.visit1000islands.com/ "Visit") of some of the 1700 islands and homes.
