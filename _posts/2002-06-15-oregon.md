Eureka
------

Leaving Eureka still heading north on Hwy 1 or 101 was much the same as the last couple of days. Curves Curves and more Curves, just what motorcycles were made for. It's about a four hour ride from Eureka to Bandon, OR depending on how much you stop to take pictures etc. It took us about 5 hrs. But we also stopped for breakfast. Along the coast of Oregon is Gold Beach, Port Orford, Cape Blanco (Cape Blanco Light House) and Bandon. Just north of Bandon is Bandon/Port Orford KOA it's small but nice secluded sites.


Just north of Bandon is Coos Bay and south west of Coos is a very nice ride around a loop from Hwy 101 to the coast fishing village of Charleston south of this Village is a couple of stops that are a must see if you are in this area. Sun Set Bay St. Park, Shore Acres St. Park, and Cape Arago St. Park. Sunday Fathers day they had a Wildlife viewing at Simpson Reef & Shell Island at Cape Arago. Folks that belong to Friends of Shore Acres is a private non-profit cooperative that provides educational and interpretive services for the parks in the area. Sunday they had spotting scopes setup and were available to talk about the wildlife. We were able to see California Sea Lion, and Steller Sea Lions through the spotting scopes they sure are noisy.

There is also a nice Botanical Garden at Shore Acres. If you get a chance see this.

Monday we left the KOA heading north again. It was raining just enough to get the 101 wet, the bike and trailer dirty. Well that did not last long soon it was raining harder. Continuing on the rain let up for a while and there was a car wreck that took us about 1 hour to get thru. Then it started raining again and kept it up. We finial decided to stop about 2:00 in Newport and spend a couple of nights at La Quinita Inn. The weather report said it should rain through Tuesday. Can not see much of the scenery in the rain and fog. So the hotel was a good choice. Ordered in Pizza on Monday evening and just lay around on Tuesday. We did go down to the warf on Tuesday and had lunch at Mo's restaurant. It is famious for it's clam chowder. In fact you can order it on the web at http://www.moschowder.com. If you are in Newport make sure you stop by Mo's for some great food. We just happend by and it was full of people on Tuesday at 1:30. Anytime you see a place that's full of people on a weekday, it must be a good place to eat and it was.
