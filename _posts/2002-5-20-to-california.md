San Antonio, TX 05/01/02
------------------------

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/almo.jpg) Alamo

Wednesday after doing laundry at Padre we left heading North on I37 to San Antonio. It was very hot today, 99 when we pulled into San Antonio, so we got a Motel 6. Then we went downtown to the Alamo and to the River Walk.

The Alamo story can be seen at [The Alamo](http://www.thealamo.org/index.html "Alamo"). Or you can just read this quick intro. The Alamo Story is Thirteen fateful days in 1836. The Alamo was originally named Mision San Antonio de Valero. It was built in 1724. In the early 1800's the Spanish military stationed a cavalry unit at the former mission. The soldiers referred to the old mission as the Alamo (Spanish word for "cottonwood") in honor of their hometown Alkamo de Parras, Coahuila.

On February 23, 1836 Sanata Anna's army started a 13 day siege against the Alamo defended by Ben Milam Texian and Tejano Volunteers. Willaim B. Travis the commander of the Alamo sent forth couriers carrying pleas for help to communities inTexas. On the eight day of the siege, a band of 32 volunteers from Gonzales arrived, bringing the number of defenders to nearly two hundred.

Colonel Travis drew a line on the ground and asked any namn willing to stay and fight to step over- all except one did. As the defenders saw it the Alamo was key to the defense of Texas, and they were ready to give their lives rather than surrender their position to General Santa Anna. Among the Alamo's garrison were Jim Bowie, and Davie Crockett.

The final assault came before dayberak on the morning of March 6, 1836, as columns of Mexican solders emerged from the predawn darkness and headed for the Alamo's walls. About 4000 against the 200 defending the Alamo.

While the facts surrounding the siege of the Alamo continue to be debated, there is no doubt about what the battle has come to symbolize. People worldwide continue to remember the Alamo as a heroic struggel against overwhelming odds- a place where men made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. For this reason the Alamo remains hallowed ground and the Shrine of Texas Liberty.

Fredericksburg

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/flowers_tx_roadside.jpg) Roadside Stop




We left San Antonio about 8:00 and headed north east on I-35 to Braunfels and Historic Gruene. Where Pat could shop and shop and shop. We had breakfast at Mama Nessa's Bakery - good - good. While talking to the owner of Buck Pottery he suggested we take the River Road to Sattler. Nice drive the Guadalupe river is very slow and green. A lot of folks use it for Cannoing.
From Sattler we took South Access Rd. below the dam for Canyon Lake. Then north west on 306 to 281. North on 281 to Johnson City. Then west on 290 to Fredericksburg for the next two nights at a KOA.
The largest wildflower fame is a very nice place to stop on 290 about 7 miles east of Fredericksburg. The picture for today is from there.
Tomorrow should be fun in Luckenbach, TX.


Luchenbach, TX 
--------------

Luchenbach, TX is a thriving metroplis of 3 persons. It's located about 16 miles southeast of Fredricksburg, just off Texas 1376. The moto is Everybody's Somebody in Luchenbach. There is a Bar, Store, and Dance Hall, and one old house. But the beer is good and the atmosphere is great.

Albuquerque

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/n-of-abq.jpg) North of Albuquerque with Doug & Ilir

My brother Doug and I road Tuesday May 7th headed west on I-40, we were running about 80 and were passed by a 2002 grey wing riding double . He must have been going 90+., but we had a tail wind of at least 20. At Grant we turned south on 117 to Malpais. Then on to La Ventana Natural Arch, a few more miles south to the Lava Beds where we turned around and headed back to Albuquerque on the same roads. Just a quick trip about 180 miles.

Sunday Doug, Ilir (Doug's son in law), Pat and I road on some great roads northwest on 550, and 4 through Las Almos then northeast through Chimayo, Cordoya, Truches, Penasco, Vadito, Taos, and back to Albuquerque. It was about 55 deg when we left, but dropped as we increased altitude to 8600 feet to about 44 deg. Some of the best riding country we have been in so far on this trip. But much more to come farther north.

Today was a great riding day, we left Albuquerque about 9:00 heading south on I-25 to Socorro about 70 miles, then west on 60 to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The Very Large Array (VLA) is made up of 27 85 ft dish's. They are setup in an X pattern on the 7000 ft high Planes of San Agustin. It takes from 2 hrs to 24 hrs to move one dish to a new location, they just finished the 1000 move in the last 20 years of operation. If you get a chance it's a very interesting visitors center.

After leaving NRAO we continued on west to Detin then southwest on 12 to 180 just south of Reserve. Lunch about 3:00 in Reserve. There were some great pictures of Elk that were taken in the area of Reserve. After lunch heading south on 180 to 78. Highway 78 west into AZ is a very nice ride great curves from 15MPH to 25MPH for the 25 miles. 


Tucson, AZ 05/15/02 - 05/19/02
------------------------------


![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/tucson.jpg) 

We arrived at Dave and Dee's in Tucson on Wednesday about 1:00, had a very nice ride down from Safford, except it started getting hot about 11:00. I guess thats to be expected in AZ from May through October. Dave and Dee are long time friends from Colorado, Dave and I started with IBM in 1966 both working in the machine shop. We both have been riding Goldwings since 82 and members of GWRRA most of that time. In the evening we went to Chapter A dinner ride, well ride across town and to dinner, the ride back across town. There were 12 people 1 from Florida ( A salesman ) 2 from Kentucky (us), and the rest from Chapter A. Had a nice dinner and met some great people. Even some more ex Coloradians.

Up early on Thursday to ride up Mt Lemon for breakfast. Mt Lemon is 8,000 ft. at the end of the road per my GPS much cooler at that Altutide, a very plesent ride and breakfast with good friends.

Friday was another day of riding, but this time we road the loop, at least thats what Dave calls it. You go south on Hughton road across I-10 continuing south on 83 right on 82 to Patagonia for breakfast then on to Nogalas. The north to Rio Rico and thu a residential area on the hills. Then north back to Tucson.

Saturday morning was GWRRA Chapter A meeting then a visit to the AZ Honda for there open house. Dave and I road VTX's for about 20 min. Nice bike with lots of power, but does not compair to the GoldWing. About 3:15 we left for a Starlight dinner and ride/game by Chapter F similar to a poker from the park in Casa Grande about 50 miles and back to the park for the prizes. Arrived back at Dave and Dee's just after midnight.

Sunday we were off to Gilbert to visit more long time friends.


Phoenix
-------

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/sadeona.jpg)

Sunday was a warm day riding from Tucson to Phoenix (Gilbert). We left Dave and Dee's about 8:00 and picked up Jeb and Christy then headed north for a nice breakfast in Catalina. After eating and visiting for a while, Pat and I headed on north on 72 to Gilbert, AZ to spend a few days with Rickie and Bo Van Oss. Long time friends.



Monday and Tuesday Bo had to work, Pat and Rickie went shopping I stayed home and worked on the computer, read, and cleaned the bike and trailer. Wednesday Bo and I played Golf in the morning. Pat was sick Wednesday I think it was somthing she ate. Thursday she felt better so we took a ride up to Sadeona, Cottonwood and Jerome very pretty area Sadeona is full of tourists. Jerome is an old copper mining town up high on the side of a mountain about 7500 ft. Bo and I sat in a biker bar and had a couple of beers while Pat and Rickie went exploring the shops (what else!). 


Friday morning we left Rickie and Bo's to meet Tucker and Ed in Montacello, Utah. Heading north east from Phoenix on 87, 188, 260, 277, 377, I-40 east to 191 then north to Chinle. A great ride 80 deg leaving Phoenix and dropped to a low of 63 at about 7700 ft., and not too much traffic. Chinle is just west of Canyon de Chilly. Tomorrow we will take a bike tour of the north rim of the canyon, maybe we can get some good pictures.



Hanksville
----------

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/ferry_powell.jpg) Ferry across Lake Powell

Sunday we left Hanksville about 8:00 heading to Hatch via Scenic byway US-24 to Capitol Reef National Park then south on Scenic Byway 12 through Boulder, Esclante, to Bryce Canyon National Park. This is an amazing country, it changes completely from high desert to canyons then to pine covered mountains about 8600 ft. elevation. Some other points of interest you may want to visit along these roads are Anasazi Indian Village State Part, Grand Staircase-Esclante National Monument, Calf Creek Rec Area, Escalante Petrified Forest State Park and Kodachrome Basin State Park just south of Cannonville.

Plan on warm clothes for early mornings in late May along this route, it was about 40 to 45 until 9:00 or so then stayed less than 80 during the afternoon hours. Great riding weather.

I think this is some of the most beautiful country we have ridden through on so far, and the best weather.

Las Vegas
---------

Las Vegas is a great place to visit, but I sure would not like to live there, it's hot and crowded with tourists. If you love to gamble it's its the place to go, if you love to stay up late and sleep very late, its the place to go, if you like to go to shows, its the place to go, if you like bright lights and a quick wedding, its the place to go. But if you like peace and quite don't go to Vegas.

We stayed at Circus Circus for three nights, visited some of the casinos, gambled a little, saw a show (Elvis copy cat), watched the light show on Freemont street, did some shopping (Pat did). If you go this year don't miss the Guggenheim Motorcycle exhibit in the Valencia they have 140 like new motorcycles from the last 100 years. If you love motorcycles it's a must see.

See more pictures of the area at [Trip](https://plus.google.com/photos/104475743350083455062/albums?banner=pwa/ "2002 trip") 

Southern Ca.
------------

After leaving Las Vegas, we headed for Pat's aunt and uncle's in Perris, CA., it's about 19 miles south of Riverside. Bob is retired from the Air Force, and an ex Motor home enthusiast. So he loved talking about traveling and camping. It was a very nice visit for a couple of days with family.

On Tuesday we headed west on 74 (The Ortages), it's a great road for bikes especially sport bikes. Sixteen sport bike guys were killed on this road in 2001. The CHP lost a cruisers trying to catch a sport bike that were trying to outrun the cops.

On Wednesday Pat and I road to San Diego to see the Zoo and ride around the town where we live in 1964 right after we were married. It sure has changed, just like everything and everyone else.

The last two nights we stayed with Pat's cousin in Capistrano Beach.

San Deigo Zoo
-------------

San Deigo Zoo is a special place in our life. Pat and I went there when we lived in Chula Vista just after we were married in 1964 she was 19 and I was 20 she got in for child's age 14. I was still in the Navy. 

Heading North
-------------

 Thursday we left Hazel's (Pat's cousin) about 9:00. We did not get to see much of Hazel on Wednesday evening she took Shannon her daughter to the hospital, they did a apendectomy about 2:30 in the morning. She is doing fine now,so I guess we will see Hazel, Chris, and maybe Kathy in Cheyenne for Frontier Days.

Riding up the cost thur LA on Hwy 1 is not much fun, there was an accident, a suburban broad sided a new explorer and turned it on it's side. I guess SUV's are famous for turning over! So we had to wait about 1 hour in traffic to get by. Finally thru LA we made better time. Finally stayed in Bulleton then the second night we stayed in San Simion state park just south of Hearst Castle. Spent the afternoon touring the Castle. What a fantastic place!


![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/herast.jpg) San Simion

The next morning we headed on up the coast to Santa Cruise via some shopping in Monterey fisherman's wharf. We decided to put new tires on the bike, but The American Honda shop is closed on Monday so we need to stay one more night. Tomorrow Tuesday we have an appointment at 9:00, then north again up Hwy 1. We may stay a day or two in SF or maybe not.
