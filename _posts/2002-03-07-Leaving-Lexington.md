![Leaving]({{localhost}}/img/leaving_lex.jpg "Leaving Home") Leaving Lexington

Wednesday Day One
-----------------

March 7, 2002 

Wednesday was between a cold and a rainy day, a good day to leave for southern states!

Heading south on I-75 was the quickest way to beat more cold and rainy weather, but the day was great for travel. We only stopped for gas and at one rest stop before Ashville, NC., pulled into Spartensburg about 4:00 in the afternoon. A good time to stop for the first day.

Thursday Day Two
----------------

Thursday was another day of riding without much site seeing.

We left Spartensburg SC about 9:10 heading southeast on I-26, thought we may make Jacksonville FL, but when we got close to Savannah, GA Pat wanted to stop and visit the old homes or take a tour of the town. So we stayed two nights at Savannah South KOA on US 17 just west of I-95 at exit 87.

Friday Day Three
----------------

On Friday we did the tourestie thing and took a trolly tour. You can get off and or on at any of the trolly stops, makes it nice to see the town. 


Saturday rough start Day Four
-----------------------------

Saturday morning we had a rough start trying to get everything back in the trailer and bike. Everything just would not fit, I think Pat bought some things and did not tell me. We had to load the ice chest with bike covers and chaps. Finally we left the KOA at 10:00AM, but only got as far as St. Augustine. I guess we won't make bike week. But there sure were a lot of bikes down in old town St. Augustine, and I am sure we will see quit a few more on the road Sunday. Yesterday and today coming down I95 it seamed like we pasted at least 1000 bikes going north some riding and some in trailers. 
We made it to St. Augustine Saturday afternoon and stayed a couple of days.


Continuing South
----------------

Leaving St. Augustine traveling south on A1A is cool comapired to inland you get the Atlantic sea breeze most of the time. That makes for a more plesent ride if the wind doesn't get to strong. Today was great about 80Deg. with a 10MPH wind from the east.

There were alot of bikes going north, leaving bike week, guess some people have to go back to work on Monday.

We did not even stop in Daytona (except for all the stop and go traffic). Keep on going south and it's getting warmer. 


Coral Springs
-------------

Wednesday we headed south on toward Coral Springs, Steve & Joann Spanoudis's home, it's not that far for one day's drive. Arrived in Coral Springs about 2:00 so we caught a movie, Steve and Joann weren't expecting us until late afternoon.

Steve and I worked together for 8 or 9 years in the PTC. After I left to take the sysadmin job he quit and took a job here in Coral Springs with Motarolla as manager of prototype projects.

We had a great visit with old friends, they have a very nice house in a great neighborhood.


Lion Country Safari
-------------------

![Header]({{ localhost }}/img/jaraffes.jpg)

Monday evening at the KOA it rained three or four times during the night. It was nice to hear the rain coming down on the tent. It's also very different waking up to the sound of Lions Roaring loud enought to wake you from a sound sleep. That's a first for Pat and I. Tusdsay moring we just had to go see thoes Lions.

Lion Country Safari KOA is at the entrance to Lion Country Safari (guess thats why they have the same name). Anyhow back to the subject, the Safari is the first drive thru Zoo in your own car, but not on a motorcylce you would not want to be eaten by a 500lb Lion. So they furnish a car (for a fee) or van if you don't have one. Ours was a Mecury station wagon painted white with black zebra stripes, it's better than being eaten for dinner. It takes about 1.5 to 2hrs to drive thru and see all the animals. At one point there was a 5000lb Rino with his horn about a foot from my door, it didn't bother Pat it was not on her side. Ten Giraff's were all coming towards us because there were two right in our path about 5 feet from the car, couldn't even see there heads, util the smaller one headbutted the larger one in the ribbs. I guess that's the way one says to the other get out of my way!

The rest of the afternoon was just lazy Pat got her hair cut and we ate at Woody's Barbcue. Now we are just hanging around camp reading and typing this. Tomorrow we will go the Butterfly World on our way to the Keys.


South to Key West
-----------------

Thursday morning about 9:00 we left Spanoudis's home for Key West. Heading south on the Florida Turnpike it was hot and fast trip if you keep up with traffic. The speed limit is 70 and most folks are running 80. Pat doesn't like the Interstates anyway.



The Keys are a great place to visit if you like a lot of people and slow traffic, it's about 100 miles from the beginning of Key Largo to the last one Key West most is two lane and very busy even during the week.

KOA Fiesta was our camping place for the next two nights, not a bad camp site, but still 64 miles to Key West.

Key West
--------

Friday was our day at Key West. After riding around the city, which doesn't take that long, because it's not all the large, we parked the bike and walked Duval street. Spent some time in the shops, had lunch, then stopped at the Hog's Breath Saloon for a couple of beers, visited with a few folks from up north. Then headed back to the KOA.
