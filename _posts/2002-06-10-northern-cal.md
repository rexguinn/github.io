Tuesday after getting new tires on the bike at All American Honda in Santa Cruz we headed north to S.F. and across the Golden Gate Bridge, of course it was very cold and foggy so we couldn't see much of anything. I stopped at the view point on the Sousalito side of the bridge. 

On north on Hwy 101 to San Francisco North Petaluma KOA. This is one very nice KOA. There are trees and grass everywhere and it's also one of the more expensive, but California is about 25% more for everything than the rest of the country.

Napa Valley
-----------

On Wednesday we headed west to Napa and Napa Valley for some wine country tours and some good riding country. The first stop was Robert Mondavi Vineyard. I have been to this one twice and It's one of the best today John Write was our tour guide, he is a retired CEO of one of the vineyard's in Napa Valley. So he new his wines and alot about the Valley he had lived there since 1966. For 10 bucks you get a 1.5 hr tour plus three different wines to tast. We also went to the Beringer
Vineyard, which was also 10 bucks, but it only lasted 10 minutes and had five wines to tast. Needless to say the eight different wines gave me a headache. So before we started back over the mountains to the KOA we stopped for dinner at a very nice Italian restaruant (Checkers) in Calistoga the norther part of Napa Valley. We took the Petrified Forrest Road back west. Nice twisty mountain road.

After leaving Petaluma KOA we headed north on 101 then west on 116 over to Hwy 1. Continuing on north via 1 to Mendocino where we stayed the night at Sea Rock Inn a B&B. The weather was cool and cloudy. We walked around Mendocino and had dinner. Mendocino is a small sea coast town with a lot of tourists. The ride was slow with lots of curves from 15 MPH to 30 MPH. Some road construction but not to bad.

On Thursday we headed on North on Hwy 1 to Leggett and Aveneue of the Giants. The Redwoods are huge and old, some are as old as 2000 years.
